A Pomodoro for our Community

Let's be crazy and create our own pomodoro project, suiting our community's specific wants and needs :) A few features it should probably have:

have a specific link that can be shareable, so that a group can follow the same pomodoro
have customizable times (25 min or 50 min work, 5, 10 or 20 min breaks)
have a title for the task being done... What else? You tell me!

## How to install the Discord Bot:

1. Set an environment variable with your BOT_TOKEN in your hosting environment.
2. > node pomodoro.js

## How to run work session

`!start-pom <work duration> <break duration> <# work sessions(optional:default 5)> ` - Will start a pomodoro timer
